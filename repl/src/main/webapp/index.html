      <h1>What is PIQL?</h1>
      <p>
        Large-scale websites are increasingly moving from relational databases to distributed key-value stores for high request rate, low latency workloads.
        Often this move is motivated not only by key-value storesâ€™ ability to scale simply by adding more hardware, but also by the easy to understand predictable performance they provide for all operations.
        While this data model works well, lookups are only done by primary key. More complex queries require onerous, explicit index management and imperative data lookups by the developer.
        We demonstrate PIQL, a Performance Insightful Query Language that allows developers to express many of the queries found on these websites, while still providing strict bounds on the number of I/O operations for any query.
      </p>

      <h1>What websites have been build using PIQL?</h1>
      <p>
        One of our motivating applications is SCADr, a clone of twitter.
        Implemented using PIQL, SCADr demonstrates that even relatively complex queries like the "thoughstream" can be implemented in a performance safe way.
      </p>

      <h1>But can normal developers use it?</h1>
      <p>
        As part of the <a href="http://radlab.cs.berkeley.edu">RAD Lab</a> Final Demo, we have hired a number of undergraduates, with only a semester of web development experience, to create compelling large scalable application.
        Using the PiqlOnRails library they have implemented two prototype applications.
        While porting their applications from ActiveRecord to PIQL, the undergraduates were forced to make some changes to their data model including removing the dependence on auto-incrementing primary keys. (A change Twitter was recently forced to make due to scaling issues.)

      <h1>Does it scale?</h1>
      <p>
        Since it runs on top of a scalable key/value store and each query performs only a bounded number of simple operations, out initial performance tests unsurprisingly show linear scaling as we add machines to the cluster

      <h1>What about queries I can't run in PIQL</h1>
      <p>
        Due to the strict performance requirements of interactive applications, PIQL won't let you run interesting analytics queries that touch unbounded amounts of data.
        However, all PIQL entities are serialized using Apache Avro, and thus it is relatively easy to write batch queries using other frameworks like Hadoop which are intended for operator-facing batch queries.
      </p>
      <h1>How can I try it out?</h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="/piql.html">PIQL Query Visualizer</a> is preloaded with example entities and queries from the SCADr application.
        However, there are currently some unsafe queries that could slow down the site if it were to become popular.
        From the editor you can use the query visualizer to find the parts of the queries that are performance unsafe and fix them using LIMIT clauses and data cardinality constraints.
