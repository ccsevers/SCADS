SCADR-Rails
===========
An implementation of SCADR, a Twitter clone, that is built on Rails.

Note
-----
The PIQL version of the application will require piql.jar to be located at db/piql.jar

Implementation
--------------
Due to PIQL being largely an unknown factor, I propose that there at all times be two branches to SCADR-Rails:

* master - Designed for SQLite
* piql - Branch of master which uses PIQL

Hopefully, the development phase on master will be relatively short, and most of the work will instead be done on the piql branch.
