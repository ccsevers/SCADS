;; SCADS .ensime file

;; NB: Unfortunatly, adding in the "config" project as a dep of
;; anything will cause the analyzer to crash (at least on my
;; machine). This has something to do with "config" being the thing to
;; include scalatest.  This means your error checker won't be able to
;; find scalatest and will complain about any files that include it.
;; If you figure out a way to fix this, please let me (nick) know.
